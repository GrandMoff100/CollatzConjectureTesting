# Collatz Conjecture Testing

[Source Idea from Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

# Rule
If the previous number in the sequence is odd the next term is three times the previous term plus one.

If the previous number in the sequence is even then the next term is the previous term divided by two.

If the previous term is one then the sequence is complete.


# Theory
A sequence following the Rule starting with any natural number will end in one.

# Testing
Clone or download the repository.
Run main.py with `python main.py`
It will start to endlessly list numbers and the length of their corresponding sequences.
